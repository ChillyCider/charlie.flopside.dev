We had another session of DCC RPG, using Paul Wolfe's [*The Curse of Cragbridge*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/170649/The-Curse-of-Cragbridge--DCC-RPG)
as our adventure. You know, after nearly two months of exclusively playing Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) games, it took a few minutes to get used
to regular dungeon crawling again. Thankfully, DCC RPGs rules are quick to pick back up!

This wasn't our first time exploring the depths of the tower overlooking Cragbridge. We're actually about 7 sessions into this particular
adventure. Our DCC RPG sessions tend to be about an hour long, two hours tops. That time frame fits in all our schedules, but it means we make progress
very slowly. We've gotten pretty good at packing a lot of content into short sessions, though.

Something interesting happened in this session. The adventurers were exploring one of the lower floors of the tower overlooking Cragbridge, and they
encountered their first real peril. They'd encountered traps and monsters before, but this time the adventurers were significantly overpowered by their foes:
undead arachnid-human hybrids with metal limbs. Upon opening the door, the adventurers knew something was wrong. There were four wide columns in the room.
Sounds could be heard -- the sound of skittering movement, and the sound of ceaseless exhalation. They would have been fine. But they weren't, because the thief
who opened the door (named Sneaky Sebastian) tripped over his own feet and fell face-first into the room. Our dwarf named Rigor Roy sprang in front of Sebastian
to protect him.

The arachnid horrors were already slinking out of their hiding spots when the party's weapons were readied.

Several swings were made, but all missed. Finally, one of the monsters reached out a cold hand. The hand began to glow, and it touched the shoulder of
Dannah, our elvish sage. Dannah collapsed.

Astrid, our other thief, ducked to help Dannah.

Wyewok the halfling maintained a steady assault with his bejeweled dagger while the others recuperated.

Rigor Roy and Sebastian both got bit by the spiders. At this point, the adventurers lost hope and retreated, carrying their wounded in tow. Wyewok saved them
all by tossing chicken meat toward the spiders and everybody dashed out.

At this point, it was time to see who lived. In DCC RPG, if a person is dead after a battle, they're not actually *gone* yet. You get one last chance to
"roll them over" and check their breath. We did that.

Every. One. Survived.

I, as the GM, was stunned. I think the players were too. Dannah, Rigor, and Sebastian now have permanent scars from the battle which reflect their close scrape
with death.

For Dannah: blue lightning webs across her skin starting at the shoulder, where the spider grabbed.

For Rigor: blue teeth marks on the back of his neck, surrounded by pale-blue skin, if I remember correctly.

For Sebastian: blue lightning webs across his skin starting at the thigh, where the spider grabbed.

Overall, it was a fun session. When the adventurers retreated from the tower, they sought out a cleric in town. There were no clerics. However,
there was a simple priest(ess) whose gender we haven't decided yet. The adventurers offered 2000 gold to the earth goddess, and she rewarded them
by reincarnating a cleric from the distant past and placing them in the body of the priest(ess). Now this cleric will join the party.

We have a cleric now!
