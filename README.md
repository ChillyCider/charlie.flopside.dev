# Charlie's Blog

This repo holds the content for my blog, [Charlie's Blog](https://charlie.flopside.dev/).

## Workflow

My blog is a static and is generated by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). The following
steps are what I use to get up and running.

### Setup

Create a virtualenv for Python:

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtualenv (Windows only):

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Activate the virtualenv (non-Windows only):

```
venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Put this in a `.env` file at the root of the repo:

```
S3_BUCKET=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_HERE
```

### Publishing and Uploading

To generate the static HTML files for the site, I first activate the virtualenv:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then, I generate the website using this script that I wrote:

```
python publish.py
```

This is essentially the same as `make publish`, except it works on Windows too.

Finally, to upload to S3 I run:

```
python upload.py
```

Which is essentially the same as `make s3_upload`, except it works on Windows
and it doesn't automatically run the publish procedure as we did above.

NOTE: To upload to S3 your AWS credentials need to be set up. That process
is explained by other people on the Internet, so I won't try.

### Things you'll want to change

If you're using this repo as a basis for your own website, you definitely want
to poke your head into `pelicanconf.py` and `publishconf.py` and change things.
I'll leave the specifics to you.
